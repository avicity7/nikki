### Preface
Romance. It's the genre that I've watched the most of, and probably why I will continue to watch anime.
There's something that these shows carry that others don't. A lot of these shows don't just stop at Romance for the sake of romance, but some also highlight the development of characters and evolution of their mindsets and outlooks towards life.

This post will include a *lot* of spoilers, so let me list the shows I'll be discussing. I'd strongly recommend finishing these before reading this.

- [Re:LIFE](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30015/ReLIFE)
- [The World God Only Knows 「神のみぞ知る世界」](https://myanimelist.net/anime/8525/Kami_nomi_zo_Shiru_Sekai)
- [Amagami SS 「アマガミSS」](https://myanimelist.net/anime/8676/Amagami_SS)
- [SSSS.Gridman](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35847/SSSSGridman)
- [SSSS.Dynazenon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40870/SSSSDynazenon)
- [Saenai Kanojo no Sodatekata 「冴えない彼女の育てかた」](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23277/Saenai_Heroine_no_Sodatekata)

To best get what I'm rambling on about I'd recommend finishing these serieses, at least whatever is animated. Re:LIFE is best consumed by finishing the manga, however. Apart from that, only TWGOK is not fully animated.  

In this post, I'd like to talk about some main takeaways and some small details found in these shows.
Hopefully you, the reader, would find it as useful as they've been in my life.

<!-- In TWOGK, Katsuragi Keima has no interest in 3D girls but manages to use tactics he's learnt from *gal games*. Saekano then shows us the evolution of creators, dreamers and at their core, flawed humans. Through Amagami SS, we see Tachibana Junichi get stood up on Christmas and how he (in different timelines) goes on to capture the hearts of different archetypes of girls. -->

### Re:LIFE
In Re:LIFE, we get a magic pill that returns our protagonist, Arata Kaizaki, to his high school age.
With this return to youth, he gets the chance to go back to school.
It's important to remember that the reason he went back to school was not because he was a failure -- it was because of a traumatic event he experienced after working for only 3 months leading to him quitting his job.

One thing led to another, and now he's unable to hold a decent job.
This premise alone struck a chord with me, with being thrown into a new phase in life with no clear direction and nothing but uncertainty.

#### Just take a pill.
I don't mean that in the literal sense -- the Re:LIFE pill obviously doesn't exist.
What I mean is in the social media -pill sense, whichever colour of the rainbow the positive one is.

I had a bunch of insecurities and nothing but time on my hands, so I decided to start a journey to change myself.
I'm still on that journey, but I wouldn't be where I am without deciding to start it there and then.


#### No one is truly gone. 
At the end of the series (in the manga), we see Kaizaki join the Re:LIFE office and start his new job as a handler.
This closes a nice loop for the series, and leaves us with a nice message that there are many of us that need to change and it's not impossible.

### TWGOK & Amagami SS
TWGOK runs on the premise of a gamer using his knowledge of *gal games* in real life while Amagami SS is an adaptation whose source material is a VN. In a way, these two utilise the same narrative method of going through a capture process, with the goal of *kouryaku* 攻略 or "capture".

#### Interactions are like a game.
Not just in romance-based interactions, but nearly everything. Like Keima, you'd have to adjust your approach parameters and be on the ball, but the goal for most interactions can be achieved through careful and precise planning.

It's something that's really obvious, but keeping this in mind has helped me think through my actions and how the other party may respond to them. This has mostly led to more positive outcomes for myself. *Mostly*.

#### With just a bit of effort, life could be different.
This one's a bittersweet one -- watching Keima and Junichi go on different "quests" and timelines gives you a glimpse of all the *what-ifs* in life.
Especially in Amagami SS, none of the heroine routes are forced or spring out of nowhere.
The entry to those routes have always been there, it just took a couple of steps to find them.
Like for Junichi in the Ayatsuji Tsukasa route, all he had to do was volunteer to be part of the School Festival preparations.

Personally, I've grown to be more confident of my place in the world, cognizant that there's almost always an option to start something and it just takes effort.
No girlfriend? *Just find one!*
Bad grades? *Just study better!*
Can't speak a language? *Start learning it now!*

It's a naive mindset, but it's given me the courage to take that first step. And sometimes, that's all that's needed.

### SSSS Series
I like to call the SSSS series Neon Genesis Evangelion *lite*. I mean, there's even a NERV reference in Gridman!

### Saekano
Man, where do I start with this one. 2 seasons and a movie of pure perfection.
Don't be led astray by the fanservice that opens Episode 0 (or throughout the series for that matter), it's an epic of creators, prodigies, dreamers and most importantly humans, humans that can err.

#### To grow, you need to be challenged.
Doujinshi Circle "Rouge en route" leader Kousaka Akane took away Eriri and Utaha-senpai from blessing software.

To a regular viewer, they may view Akane with ire for doing so.

However, like Tomoya Aki, I accept that leaving was the correct decision for them.
They needed someone to challenge them, someone who thought they work was worthless and reproducible.
Only through this challenge will they be able to grow as creators.

Reflecting on my lived experience, I've only grown as a person when the environment was harsh, unforgiving and demanding.
Perhaps I harbour negative feelings for those times, but without those times I wouldn't even be stressed about my abilities.

This mindset is a little toxic, but serves as a good reminder to always demand 120% from both myself and team members.

#### Normal is good.
「私は、あなたが望むメインヒロインに、なれたかな？」

The legendary rhetorical posed by Katou Megumi -- *did I manage to become the heroine you wish for?*

Of course she did. Throughout the series, she's been the only obvious choice for Tomoya.
Both Eriri and Utaha-senpai were options, but they were just that, options.
Leading back to the previous points regarding Re:LIFE, it was always possible for Tomoya to go on a *capture route* with the both of them.
I mean they are classics, the tsundere childhood friend and stern senpai.

But apart from those, they wouldn't actually get along well with Tomoya in a healthy relationship.

Eriri was always hurt by their experience as children, and so was Tomoya.
It's possible to repair such a wound, but not without more pain.

Utaha's dependence on Tomoya's feelings about her work hurt her deeply, and that dependence on him did not sit well with Tomoya -- earning him the Mr.Ethical nickname.

In the end, the only person who saw Tomoya for who he was and acknowledged him as a normal person with flaws, dreams and a good heart was Megumi. She did not know this herself, and we saw her uncover it in both S2E8 (the recording room scene) and the Fine movie.

I quite like how applicable this message is, with it's relevance to Mari from the Neon Genesis Evangelion Rebuilds, Ayatsuji Tsukasa from Amagami SS, Kosaka Chihiro from The World God Only Knows, and probably so many others I'm likely forgetting.

To close it off, I hope that you, the reader have found your normal, your reason in the world.
I'll keep looking for mine.
