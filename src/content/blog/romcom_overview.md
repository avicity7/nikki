#### **Preface**
This post will include a *lot* of spoilers, so let me list the shows I'll be discussing. I'd strongly recommend finishing these before reading this.

- Re:LIFE
- The World Only God Knows 「神のみぞ知る世界」
- Saenai Kanojo no Sodatekata 「冴えない彼女の育てかた」
- Amagami SS 「アマガミSS」
- Hatsukoi Gentei 「初恋限定」

To best get what I'm rambling on about, I'd recommend finishing these serieses, at least whatever is animated. Re:LIFE is best consumed by finishing the manga, however. Apart from that, only TWOGK is not fully animated.  

#### **Re:LIFE**
The theme of getting another chance at such an important period of one's life -- high school -- is found in some other works, of which I'm fond of.
