### Preface
Romance. It's the genre that I've watched the most of, and probably why I will continue to watch anime.
There's something that these shows carry that others don't.   

This post will include a *lot* of spoilers, so let me list the shows I'll be discussing. I'd strongly recommend finishing these before reading this.

- [Re:LIFE](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30015/ReLIFE)
- [The World Only God Knows 「神のみぞ知る世界」](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30015/ReLIFE)
- [Saenai Kanojo no Sodatekata 「冴えない彼女の育てかた」](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23277/Saenai_Heroine_no_Sodatekata)
- [Amagami SS 「アマガミSS」](https://myanimelist.net/anime/8676/Amagami_SS)
- [Hatsukoi Gentei 「初恋限定」](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5150/Hatsukoi_Limited)

To best get what I'm rambling on about I'd recommend finishing these serieses, at least whatever is animated. Re:LIFE is best consumed by finishing the manga, however. Apart from that, only TWOGK is not fully animated.  

In this post, I'd like to talk about some main takeaways and some small details found in these shows.
Hopefully you, the reader, would find it as useful as they've been in my life.

### Life Is Malleable
In Re:LIFE, we get a magic pill that returns our protagonist, Arata Kaizaki, to his high school age. In TWOGK, Katsuragi Keima has no interest in 3D girls but manages to use tactics he's learnt from *gal games*. Saekano then shows us the evolution of creators, dreamers and at their core, flawed humans.
